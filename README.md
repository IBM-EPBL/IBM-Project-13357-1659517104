Plant disease detection systems are capable of recognizing the disease from different plants for both vegetables and fruits. It can be done easily from anywhere from the world to find the cure for the disease of the plant. It is done by uploading the photo of the diseased plant and the model would predict the disease and the treatment for the disease
